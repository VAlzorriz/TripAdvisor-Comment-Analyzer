It's one of the better luxury hotels I've stayed in due to little details that made the stay better (electric mirror in the bathroom, slippers, etc). It's super close to the 9/11 Memorial as well. The steakhouse was excellent as well."
0.13736842105263156,0.5028947368421052,"Stayed for two nights. A few minutes walk from the WTC and Wall Street. A relatively smaller hotel comparing to some other Four Seasons. As with other Four Seasons service from staff are excellent. The overall look and feel is modern design. Our room is of decent size and has the Oculus view.  It is still spacious after we put 2 luggage in it. The bath room occupies a big part of the room, so the bath room is really spacious, and bright. Temperature control is easy. Storage space is abundance. The only complaint I have is with the bed, it is too soft for me and there is a depression in the center of the mattress.We had our breakfast in the lobby restaurant, the food was not particularly outstanding. And there is only one restaurant in the hotel. If you have activity in the area it is still a very good choice."

I mentioned in a previous comment that the quality of the hotel and the attention to service were not up to par with Four Seasons. The only detail I found impressive was a bottle of champagne chilled in our room upon arrival with a tray of cakes and “Happy Birthday” written on the plate... I immediately thanked the concierge with a tip!! Months late, I meet with a friend who I have not seen since before my birthday. He asks me how I liked the champagne and card he sent to my hotel room on my birthday to this New York hotel!! I was shocked and speechless! The hotel did not even give me the card with his gift and they did not leave their own complimentary champagne, they simply upgraded my gift at my friend’s expense and set it up as if the gift was complimentary from the hotel!! How could the staff be this negligent?? This is how Four Seasons in New York ripped off myself and my friend by having him pay for the champagne service, then taking my tip on top. Even worse, I did not thank my friend for the wonderful gift he sent on my 50th birthday which caused unexplained tension.. meanwhile the Four Seasons is pinching a penny. Bravo! Thanks for nothing!"

We ordered room service and it was delicious, the blond girl who brought us our food was very kind. Despite the terrible view, What blew me away was a front desk crew member, Sierra. She was so attentive during my stay, learned my kids name, became their friend, spoke to us anytime we were in the lobby. My girls were telling her how excited they were to go see the frozen show and she placed little frozen treats and frozen coloring books in our room for them while we were at the pool. She definitely made their first trip to the city memorable."

0.36286796536796534,0.5851948051948052,"Great stay! Very friendly team with a Four Seasons attitude instead of the typical ""New York"" attitude. Provided special attention for my daughter during our stay. The stay was a relaxing and needed break."

The style, size, and presentation of the hotel was flawless.The location was superb, very easy to get around town and safe streets when coming home late at night.What really made our stay go from pleasant and comfortable to amazing was the interactions we had with all of the staff. From before arrival organising and even amending our airport transfer due to flight delays was pleasant and the town car organised by the hotel was impeccable. Every interaction with concierge and front desk was wonderful and the housekeeping staff are a treasure!We will definitely be returning and recommending this hotel to others!"

However very disappointed I should have stayed uptown but it was sold out. Until next time Four Seasons you still have my heart. "
