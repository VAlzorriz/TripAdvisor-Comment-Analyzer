0.3886904761904762,0.6202380952380953,"Loved my stay at the Four Seasons Downtown. It's one of the better luxury hotels I've stayed in due to little details that made the stay better (electric mirror in the bathroom, slippers, etc). It's super close to the 9/11 Memorial as well. The steakhouse was excellent as well."
0.13736842105263156,0.5028947368421052,"Stayed for two nights. A few minutes walk from the WTC and Wall Street. A relatively smaller hotel comparing to some other Four Seasons. As with other Four Seasons service from staff are excellent. The overall look and feel is modern design. Our room is of decent size and has the Oculus view.  It is still spacious after we put 2 luggage in it. The bath room occupies a big part of the room, so the bath room is really spacious, and bright. Temperature control is easy. Storage space is abundance. The only complaint I have is with the bed, it is too soft for me and there is a depression in the center of the mattress.We had our breakfast in the lobby restaurant, the food was not particularly outstanding. And there is only one restaurant in the hotel. If you have activity in the area it is still a very good choice."
0.5077777777777778,0.775,"We stayed for 4 days in December 2019.  The rooms are modern, clean, very nice and spacious, and the service was excellent.  We got great recommendations from the front desk for nearby restaurants.  Absolutely no complaints."
0.2928571428571428,0.5892857142857143,"Such warm, friendly, attentive service from everyone we encountered. Great food, amenities and rooms -- can't recommend highly enough. They were so accommodating both to us and the other guests (including the bride & groom) of the wedding we were attending. "
0.19672348484848484,0.6193722943722942,"Unfortunately- I decided to celebrate my 50th birthday at this New York location, but it did not turn out how one would expect of a Four Seasons hotel! I mentioned in a previous comment that the quality of the hotel and the attention to service were not up to par with Four Seasons. The only detail I found impressive was a bottle of champagne chilled in our room upon arrival with a tray of cakes and “Happy Birthday” written on the plate... I immediately thanked the concierge with a tip!! Months late, I meet with a friend who I have not seen since before my birthday. He asks me how I liked the champagne and card he sent to my hotel room on my birthday to this New York hotel!! I was shocked and speechless! The hotel did not even give me the card with his gift and they did not leave their own complimentary champagne, they simply upgraded my gift at my friend’s expense and set it up as if the gift was complimentary from the hotel!! How could the staff be this negligent?? This is how Four Seasons in New York ripped off myself and my friend by having him pay for the champagne service, then taking my tip on top. Even worse, I did not thank my friend for the wonderful gift he sent on my 50th birthday which caused unexplained tension.. meanwhile the Four Seasons is pinching a penny. Bravo! Thanks for nothing!"
0.28795454545454546,0.743939393939394,"This property was beautiful. However the view of another building out of our window stoped us from seeing much of downtown. We ordered room service and it was delicious, the blond girl who brought us our food was very kind. Despite the terrible view, What blew me away was a front desk crew member, Sierra. She was so attentive during my stay, learned my kids name, became their friend, spoke to us anytime we were in the lobby. My girls were telling her how excited they were to go see the frozen show and she placed little frozen treats and frozen coloring books in our room for them while we were at the pool. She definitely made their first trip to the city memorable."
0.6,0.76,"Comfortable room, superb bathroom appointments and the steam and pool to relax. Kutura on reception was ever so helpful .. thank you. This hotel provides a calm within the energetic city. Great location."
0.36286796536796534,0.5851948051948052,"Great stay! Very friendly team with a Four Seasons attitude instead of the typical ""New York"" attitude. Provided special attention for my daughter during our stay. The stay was a relaxing and needed break."
0.4727575757575758,0.7275252525252525,"My wife and I had an incredible stay at Four Seasons New York Downtown Hotel. The style, size, and presentation of the hotel was flawless.The location was superb, very easy to get around town and safe streets when coming home late at night.What really made our stay go from pleasant and comfortable to amazing was the interactions we had with all of the staff. From before arrival organising and even amending our airport transfer due to flight delays was pleasant and the town car organised by the hotel was impeccable. Every interaction with concierge and front desk was wonderful and the housekeeping staff are a treasure!We will definitely be returning and recommending this hotel to others!"
-0.20625000000000002,0.5687500000000001,"Small but well appointed, door/bell agents were fantastic, bar and front desk staff were not. All the service you expect from housekeeping was on point. However very disappointed I should have stayed uptown but it was sold out. Until next time Four Seasons you still have my heart. "
0.4446969696969697,0.6955710955710956,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown New York for five nights over New Year and had a wonderful stay. The rooms are really spacious, stylish and luxurious and the spa facilities were great (although I would have loved a Jacuzzi!). The location is perfect, with easy access to the subway and in walking distance of lots of key sights. The staff were lovely and very helpful. We'd definitely stay again. "
0.012499999999999997,0.8,If your looking for a dream getaway. Then stay at the Four Seasons Downtown. The service was unbelievable and I don't believe there is another hotel out there that is nice . My only complaint was that I had to checkout. 
0.10661998132586367,0.5413071895424837,"The hotel room was large and spacious, the service at the front desk and the other staff was very professional. The rooms have all the amenities you'd expect, and the bed was comfortable. the room was also impeccably clean. Turn down service was unobtrusive and efficient.  So why only 4 stars? First the restaurant/Bar. I had two breakfasts there and an afternoon snack at the bar. Both breakfasts were just OK, with eggs that were saltless and pretty tasteless and toast that was the same. Nothing special. And the coffee was something i would expect from a diner, not from an upscale restaurant: weak and reheated, The bar service was not slow. It was glacial. I waited to ask for a coffee, I waited for a coffee. And I waited for a long time to be able to order an overpriced grilled cheese sandwich...and I waited to pay the bill. Again, not a Four Seasons experience."
0.24266666666666667,0.484,"The Four Seasons near the World Trade Center is first class all the way around.  Truly enjoyed our stay from minute we arrived we were greeted by our name and the staff was more than attentive.  Clean, first class accommodations.  Location is quiet downtown, close to subway, World Trade Centers, 911 Memorial, Brooklyn Bridge.  Highly recommend.   "
0.0703125,0.415625,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a work trip.  I have stayed at other high-end hotels in NYC and the Four Seasons rises above due to their excellent service.  I felt like an entire staff actually cared.  Little touches they add to the room, like a cleaning cloth for your glasses to a cord keeper for your charging cords."
0.6590909090909091,0.5636363636363636,"If you are traveling to New York City and staying in Downtown, then do not hesitate to stay at the best address in this part of town, at the Four Seasons Hotel Downtown. An iconic location with faultless service are hallmarks of this distinguished property. "
0.40795068027210885,0.5479591836734693,"From the moment you walk in this FS downtown you feel welcomed and at ease. Great service from everyone, going the extra mile to help you. Special thanks to Katora and the spa manager, both very friendly and very eager to help. The rooms were clean and spacious with modern facilities. The spa and the swimming pool are also great providing a place to relax after a day in the city. The food at the restaurant was excellent and the staff great. The location is convenient with many links to different areas of Manhattan (if you are a tourist). I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends. "
0.16054545454545455,0.5318181818181819,very nice new hotel. close to 9/11 memorial and other tourist attractions. I would recommend this hotel to friends visiting New York City. The front desk was helpful in finding us resturants and other attractions close to the hotel.
0.284375,0.3,"I will rate everything in this luxury property five stars - facilities (bar, meeting rooms, and guest rooms), amenities, and staff.  Guestroom and bathroom are spotless.  Professional and friendly associates.Thank you for the five-star guest experience!"
0.03462688105545247,0.34032673675530817,"We have stayed at several Four Seasons and are frequent Ritz Carlton customers.  We always expect the best at the Four Seasons, but this trip was a disappointment.  We live in New York in the suburbs and were staying in Manhattan for 2 nights.  Decided on this location as we always had great experiences with Four Seasons.   It started when no one escorted us up to the room (maybe they are used to business travelers who don’t care).  To get to the point there were 3 things that happened that ruined our stay.   1) We got back to our room Thursday evening after being out all day to find a note that the restaurant and bar were closed for a private event.  This left us no alternative at that hotel.  When we raised our concern, we were told “you can still use room service”!!!.   2) At the same time the room it was 5:00PM, and the room had not been serviced they immediately sent 2 room service attendants to service the room and while we waited in the lobby. Maybe the do not disturb light was on?  I don’t know but even if it was I would have dropped dead in the room and no one would have known.  Also if the do not disturb is on all day, ring the phone!  3) While waiting in the lobby  a woman walks down from the elevator with her dog, the dog urinates in the middle of the lobby right in front of the desk and she totally ignores it and walks out the door of the hotel.  Now this is both a hotel and multimillion dollar condos, so I suspect this was a tenant not a hotel guest.  When I complained to the desk I was told “can’t do anything about it, it’s an accident”.  They didn’t even notice it was happening until I told them and stopped someone from stepping in it. Obviously between the restaurant and bar being closed (likely favoring a condo tenant for a wedding) a tenant not even told by the hotel that their dog used the lobby as a toilet and the room not being made up  I question “what was the hotel thinking”?.  The stars aligned on several things that just shouldn’t be.  If you can’t provide a place to eat and drink (other than your room) don’t close your only venue.  It’s arrogant and an insult to your other customers.  Let your tenants know to curb their dogs."
0.1922451790633609,0.5216253443526171,We were lucky enough to stay here on our honeymoon in New York and our experience here really added to the trip overall. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff here and the room was absolutely immaculate with stunning detail in the bathroom. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud! And the staff sent up a bottle of champagne and cake to celebrate our honeymoon which was very thoughtful. The location is fantastic for touristing from - you're a stone's throw away from the World Trade Center memorial and plenty of subway stops and cafes close by.
0.1722222222222222,0.7583333333333333,"This hotel looks great, good location and nice rooms but unfortunately that’s where the good news endsIt feels like they have fired all the staff As I write this review from the lobby there is only 2 members of staff hereThe attitude is so relaxed it makes the Caribbean seem almost slick No one seems to give a fu*kI would not stay here again it shocking Much better places to stay"
0.03803418803418805,0.5824786324786325,"It's been a while since I've stayed in a 5-star hotel and the Four Seasons didn't let me down on the luxury experience.  The room was lovely, with extra touches like the TV in the bathroom mirror and an iPad for room service ordering.  Bed was comfortable, room was quiet, bathroom was nice.  The only disappointment was the lobster ramen I got from room service the noodles were overcooked and very starchy/mushy, which is never good.  And, weirdly, they never picked up the cart and the meal was still sitting out in the hallway the next morning (after they had confirmed with me that I'd leave it out there when done)."
0.37878787878787873,0.6098484848484849,"The combination of location, service, outstanding room layouts, and phenomenal food make this THE place to stay downtown in New York.  Don’t miss Cut by Wolfgang Puck, and save some time to use the spa. "
0.13633928571428572,0.5675324675324676,"We chose this location because it was convenient to get to Brooklyn for a show.  Usually we stay in Union Square or by the Park.  The hotel itself was beautiful.  The doorman was attentive and the front desk staff very helpful.  Our room was stunning and very clean.  Softest sheets I may have ever slept in.  It was hard to get out of bed!  Room service attendant was thoughtful and prompt.there seemed to be less restaurant options within walking distance than other parts of manhattan.  However, you are right by the 9/11 memorial if you want to check that out (which I highly recommend)So why not five stars? - the hot water was slow.  Like you had to start the shower and wait ten minutes for the water to get hot.- that bathtub was gorgeous.  And very very uncomfortable.  The sides were almost at 90 degree angle so you had to sit upright while taking a bath - which defeats the purpose of a relaxing soak!- the concierge recommended a restaurant to us. Which we noticed had a “B” health rating...after we already ate there!  A five star hotel should not be recommending places with anything less than an “A” health rating.All in all a good visit and I would definitely give them another chance.  "
0.014583333333333334,0.4041666666666667,"We arrived at Four Seasons downtown for my 40th birthday at the end of August for a staycation. I had an unfortunate experience at Cut that ignited a severe food allergy and fainted twice in the lobby. Long story short, I ended up in an ambulance. That said, the hotel could not have been less helpful. It seemed they not only didnt care about me as a guest, but just didnt care about me as another human being. We ended up not staying, as I wanted to be home. The best I can say is that they just could not have cared any less. For that, never again."
0.37666666666666665,0.6599999999999999,Stayed in the Hudson Suite and it was fabulous! The living area was huge and offered an eating area for in-room dining. The bedroom and closet area were nicely sized (the closet was huge!) and the master bathroom had plenty of room and a great tub for soaking! The staff was friendly and accommodating throughout my stay. The bar area was closed early during the week which seems kind of odd for NYC but everything else was on par for a Four Seasons!
0.5025,0.5525,ニューヨークのダウンタウンに位置する当ホテル。とにかく交通の便が良く、徒歩圏内にスーパーやお土産屋さんもありとても良い立地です。ブルックリンブリッジや911メモリアルセンターも徒歩圏でした。お部屋は街中のホテルにも関わらず広々していて静かで清潔で、とてもすごしやすかったです。ベッドの寝心地が大変良く、疲れが取れて観光にも最適です。大きなバスタブも設置されているので、その点も日本人にとってGOODでした。スタッフの皆さん本当にご親切で、英語が話せないにも関わらずこちらがYesかNoで回答出来るように質問してくださり、本当に助かりました。また、到着したのが深夜だったのですがお部屋に抹茶のロールケーキとメッセージ、野点セットがあり涙が出そうでした。あの晩に飲んだお抹茶は本当においしかったです。NYの思い出の半分はFour Seasons Hotelでの滞在です（笑）さすが！Four Seasons Hotel☆次にNYを訪れる際も、絶対に泊まりたいです。Thank you very much for everything. I never forget your kindness.I wish your company will have many more successful years.
0.5533730158730159,0.6445767195767196,"Amazing hotel! We love The Four Seasons Hotels worldwide but the staff at Downtown are some of the best we have ever experienced. I can’t single out one person, from the doormen to the front of house team to the waiters and bar staff in CUT to the housekeeping - all super helpful, friendly and they made my whole family feel like the most special guests. We had 3 rooms on the 19th floor. Each room was beautiful and calm after the craziness of NY. The restaurant served a lovely breakfast but the dinner and steak were exceptional. We had one of the best steaks we’ve ever had at CUT. The birthday cake for my husband after dinner was a lovely, thoughtful touch. Thank you to all at The Four Seasons Downtown, we had a wonderful stay. "

0.007575757575757589,0.5742424242424242,"Just spent one night there but it's ok, clean room, eventually not so nice towels in the bathroom (not enough for a decent shower, but' that's life) and, as usual in the US too cold as the air conditioning is always set too low for my personal point of view. Leave it at 20 Centigrades, is even to cold but affordable. "
0.42974380165289267,0.6424944903581267,"Exceptional service and accommodations!! We will definitely be returning in the near future. Upon arrival we were assisted with our luggage and welcomed into the hotel by the door man. The front desk staff were very professional and check in was seamless. Our room was a Corner Room and it was exceptional. Every detail of the room was perfect. The amenities were very high quality, the bathroom was spacious, the bed was very comfortable. The service by housekeeping and dining was phenomenal.  The level of detail in this hotel is amazing  flawless design, inviting colour schemes and incredible service. It is clear that the hotel is managed with a focus of having the guest as the number one priority.  Quality of service is always in the details and this hotel definitely resembles this. This hotel with its exceptional accommodations, high quality service and professional staff show it to be a leader in the 5 star category and an ambassador of the Four Seasons brand.We would like to thank Mr. Thomas Carreras for his exceptional hospitality and his staff for an incredible stay in New York."
0.46282590515545063,0.6524842581660765,"This is a magnificent, unique, exciting hotel which became our new favorite in NYC! Everything at Four Seasons Downtown is above and beyond the expectations. First, its location. We used to prefer Uptown but after having tried the incredible vibe of Tribeca mixed with the unparalleled service of Four Seasons we will return and recommend it to anyone. For architecture and design lovers this is a truly gem, the building designed by Architect Robert A.M. Stern is just magnificent and it add contemporary elegance to Downtown skyline. The interior is sleek and modern and the rooms - oh my God! - we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Hudson Suite which is a dream come true! We woke up with the light of the morning reflecting among the Oculus and the river and it was just breathtaking. Every detail in the room is designed to perfection, bathroom, closet, lights, curtains, linens. We loved, loved, loved our room and we loved the wonderful people of house keeping who took care of it. Thank you for your precious work. Then the pool, you have to see that! Really gorgeous! But what makes you feel like a royalty is the service: flawless, quick, professional, friendly. Just perfect. Bell men are like breeze, really the best! Front desk was exceptional and we would like to thank and congratulate Ms. Laura who was our angel throughout our stay. We had a memorable, unique experience at Four Seasons Downtown and we will never thank enough all the special Four Seasons people and most of all Mr. Thomas Carreras the finest General Manager. A great gentleman, an extraordinary professional. Thank you for making everything possible, we truly appreciated your work and recognition. Hope to be back soon."

However after waiting on Barclay street for over 8 minutes in bumper to bumper traffic. This wonder doorman walked out and provided ice cold water for me and my 2 year old daughter who was sitting in the backseat. I was beyond grateful!!!!! I called the hotel to find out his name, which is Raul!!! Thank you so much! Based on his service I will stay at The Four Seasons in the future. He is a true asset to the company."

The private bar in the room and the TV display in/behind the mirror in the bathroom are nice touches. The powered curtains blackout the light almost completely, there are multiple storage closets, and the bed was very comfortable. The lobby is small and not much to look at but the rooms are the real star here. Room service was very fast and quite good. Quick tip: There is a great vegetarian restaurant called Nish Nush a few blocks away."
-0.049999999999999996,0.41282051282051285,The door would not open four times during my short stay of 4 days. The securities came to open the room door for me were all rude. The hotel room is much smaller than it looks on the picture. I am a regular guest to four seasons hotel but after this experience may never trust this brand.

0.13506493506493505,0.5053751803751804,"My husband and I spent two nights here during our stay in the New York City. Even though we arrived at the hotel rather early, the staff was really helpful and were able to accommodate us for an early check-in and and even offered us an upgrade. The suite got a lovely bathroom and worthy of mention is the good quality of toiletries (Lorenzo Villoresi) provided. Amenities-wise, the 24-hours gym is great with treadmills (however it was a bit disappointing that 2 out of 5 of didn’t work), free weight, exercise bikes and cross trainers, overlooking the city. In term of its location, it’s conveniently located next to some key landmarks such as the World Trade Center and 9/11 memorial and is within walking distance to the Wall Street. The only drawback is that because of its close proximity to the main street, one can hear the traffics even late at night and despite us staying on the 16th floor. That aside, I would definitely recommend it."

In addition to that, Nasha, the Night Operations Manager, took the time to speak with me, as I thanked her and her team for their hard work and passion. I would also like to give a compliment to the housekeeping team for making sure the room was spotless upon her arrival. Thank you Four Seasons for a memory that will last my mom a lifetime! "

We had our wedding at the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown, and from the initial proposal to the actual wedding weekend, simply put in one word, our experience was MAGICAL. My family members and I went to the hotel 5 hours ahead of check-in time, and they were able to get us into our rooms and handled SO many bags of luggage across the multiple rooms without any hiccups. I even went to the hotel spa for a gel manicure and pedicure...perfect service, and when I noticed something on my nail the next morning (day of wedding), the hotel spa had someone come into the room to fix my nail during probably one of the busiest times of the day. Fast forward to the set-up of ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception...the wedding party didn't even know what was going on because the hotel staff took care of every detail. So many of our guests kept remarking about the food, beverages, and hotel decor. On top of that, the hotel even remembered that my sister and mother both love Tabasco, and delivered a tray of mini bottles during the reception!!! Then when our reception was over, we somehow had our items from the reception (including party favors) already delivered in the room before we even got into our room to change for our after party!!! If I could relieve the weekend over and over, I would. We couldn't have made a better choice for us to start our lives as newlyweds.

The lifeguard was very friendly (awesome pool!), spa help was wonderful! The room was always cleaned wonderfully. Everything at the Four Seasons was so much better than we could have even dreamed of! Thank you Four Season Staff for an incredible few days in NYC!!"
0.3627525252525252,0.57260101010101,"The Four Seasons Downtown has become our hotel of choice when visiting New York. We've tried many others, but this is the only hotel that consistently delivers perfect service, warm hospitality, a quiet and comfortable room, and the facilities we want (a 25 meter pool and an excellent fitness center, in particular). The staff are genuinely welcoming and helpful."
0.175,0.7,"I would recommend Four Seasons to all.  If you have the extra money to spend on a vacation, this is the place. They treat you like royalty even though we were clearly not.  Courteous, kind & helpful staff went over and beyond in making us feel comfortable & taken care of.  A++"
0.39501953125,0.5694444444444443,This was our second stay-cation at the four seasons downtown. The four seasons downtown team go way above and beyond to make sure every detail is perfect especially for a ten year old boy!!! Everyone is so kind and lovely. We love the spa and the pool and Leon and the team! Be sure to see Najla or Daisy for the best services! The rooms are quiet and comfortable an oasis of calm and luxury! We love the four seasons downtown!
0.6380952380952382,0.807142857142857,"Great hotel which is perfect in every way when visiiting NYC. If I can I try always to stay here when on business in NYC rooms are spacious, comfortable and with all ammenities you need. Views exceptional and the fitness area excellent. The staff are really professional and supportive when helping with any issues."

It was close walking distance to the 9/11 memorial and great shopping and street food were nearby as well as parks and Pace University.  The downstairs doorman of the hotel was super nice as well. Great room service offered 24 hours, comfortable cloud like beds, free wifi, and impeccable service. Try out Cut which is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant while you're there. We will be back!"
0.4803030303030303,0.6681818181818181,Beautiful suites. Great bathrooms. Spacious. Courteous staff. Good closet space. Suites have great views and are super quiet. The showers could be a bit bigger but it wasnt a big deal. Breakfast in restaurant was great. Spa is fantastic. 
0.36704545454545456,0.636679292929293,"I stayed at the Four Seasons for a couple of nights in June.  Food, staff, rooms were all great.  It is a new hotel.  I think only two or three years old.  I really liked the location and getting in and out of the city was not an issue.  The staff were always happy to help and I'll be back for sure."
0.37846681096681095,0.6501406926406926,"New hotel one block from the Freedom Tower.  Restoration Hardware type furnishings.  Very modern and clean looking.  Rooms are stocked with the latest gadgets such as automatic blinds/curtains, large TVs and excellent wifi.  Service is top notch.  Room service is pricey but excellent.  Nice pool and spa.  Not many hotels in Manhattan boast a large lap pool.  Treat your self and indulge in luxury downtown"
0.24568787878787876,0.48544848484848485,"This was my second stay at this glossy, new addition to the Four Seasons portfolio.As other reviewers have mentioned this is well-placed in this part of the city and has a good variety of different accommodation options. This time we had a Hudson Suite, which I liked as it has the second bathroom that I prefer when travelling as a couple.This trip, admittedly, I had a couple of glitches at check-in, but they were very quickly resolved and I am most impressed by the visibility of senior management in the public areas at this hotel - something that many other top hotels should look to emulate.The only reason for the mark at 4 not 5 is that this IS a Four Seasons, so expectations are high and personally I think that the breakfast service at Cut is inconsistent, often lacklustre and occasionally insolent. Is this restaurant fully managed by the FS I wonder? Incidentally, Cut has an altogether different atmosphere in the evening and service levels are more in-keeping with what you would expect. Service elsewhere is excellent, very friendly, making you feel extremely welcome.I will definitely be back whenever I am on business downtown but might opt for room-service breakfast next time!"
0.26250000000000007,0.6174999999999999,"Fantastic Hotel in Downtown. We loved the pool and the nice room. Very close to subway. Friendly staff. The restaurant was ok, but not outstanding. Only downside was, that they could not setup an extra bed or sofa for our 8 year old boy."
0.33060897435897435,0.6269230769230769,"This was the second time we stayed at the Four Seasons Downtown and is was exceptionally good again!!  The room was fantastic, my husband used the pool and fitness facilities and really enjoyed that.  The location is awesome.....we walked the Brooklyn Bridge both mornings we were there as it is only a couple of blocks from the hotel.  The staff is top notch, especially the door men with a huge shout out to Kirk in particular!!  He remembered us from last year and we even ran into him in Tribeca one afternoon away from the hotel.  He recognized us and stopped to chat for a minute.  Very friendly and courteous!  Would definitely recommend the Fours Seasons Downtown every time!!!"
0.3376893939393939,0.6370896464646465,"I've stayed here twice. The first time was a generally great stay, and I appreciated the typical Four Sesons service at a property that's super sexy and new feeling. Similar in style to The Conrad close by, but with elevated service and amenities as you'd expect with FS. I had a few issues that were so minor (room service steak ordered rare that came medium, as well as a noticeable stain on the room carpet) I didn't even feel the need to speak to the staff, I just mentioned on the survey everything wasn't absolutely perfect. Lo and behold, the GM reaches out to me via email and says he'll make sure to take care of me on a return visit. Just completed that stay and pleased to say everything was entirely flawless this time....  and yes, I re-tested the room service steak. It was deliciously rare this time."
0.32983091787439617,0.6413647342995169,"I have stayed at Four Seasons hotels all over the world and I can honestly say this is one of the absolute best.  We booked the Family Escape package which included cute things for my toddler like her own tiny bathrobe, rainbow rice crispies treats with her name in icing, a free pay per view movie, free valet, etc.  My husband, I and little Sienna were awestruck by this hotel and how well treated we all were by literally every staff member we came across.  She felt like a two foot tall celebrity and was treated like royalty and so were we. One of the things I loved about the hotel was that all requests (room service, house keeping, valet, etc) can be done through an iPad in the room which makes it incredibly fast and easy. I arrived at the hotel really hungry so was able to immediately sit down with the iPad and enter my room service order. Within 25 minutes, an impossibly charming man with an Italian accent showed up (calling my toddler ‘princess’) and set up a table in our room consisting of food that was so mind blowing it made me want to cry.  I think of myself as someone who is very hard to impress given I travel a lot and blow all of my money on nice hotels.  I’ve been underwhelmed by many hotels that have fabulous reputations, but this one blew my mind. The service, the food, the luxurious amenities, the friendly valet staff, the glorious pool - it all delivers. Literally can’t wait to go back and have that room service all over again"
0.3046875,0.6510416666666667,Spent a great long weekend at Four Seasons NYC Downtown! We were satisfied with all aspects of our stay. The room was spacious and quiet and had great views. The housekeeping service especially was absolutely outstanding.
0.225,0.4583333333333333,"The hotel is conveniently located near the World Trade Center and Wall Street m, so fairly ideal for tourists and business travelers.

The fellow who met us at the car for the valet parking asked for our name (as they all do) and then said, ""I believe your room keys are ready! (as they all do NOT!!!). In 30 seconds he was back with our keys and off we went to our perfect room.  Things only got better from there."

0.2416666666666667,0.7416666666666666,"Service and amenities are up to Four Seasons standards. Our room on the 24th floor was spacious and had a great view over WTC/Oculus. Pool and gym were also quite attractive. We were not very fond of the breakfast though: it is served in the Cut restaurant, which is nice in the evening but a bit dark in the morning and the quality of the food was not superb."

Very much what one should expect from the ""Four Seasons"" brand in terms of look, feel and vibe. Extremely comfortable room with a massive bathroom (albeit with a somewhat disappointing view) very cool and elegant bar/dining/breakfast room. Clearly a gem in this part of New York City."

From the moment we were picked up from the airport until we departed, it was the most personal service I have ever received.

0.41540616246498596,0.646498599439776,"Boutique like feel with wonderful Four Seasons service.  Tucked a block off WTC and oculus station, this feels like a new/renovated building.  Check in was easy and they were nice enough to upgrade me to a corner room.  The rooms were well designed with stylish decor.  They were also very large with big windows and plenty of natural light (to be fair I was in one of the higher floors).  The electronics in the room were nice as well.  I enjoyed breakfast in restaurant downstairs on one morning and room service on another - both excellent.  The hotel didn’t seem very crowded however even during middle of the week so I hope they are doing ok.  "
0.09723015873015872,0.5360396825396826,"I would say that the 4S Downtown is OK if you are on a business expense account and you need to visit the NY Stock Exchange or business in the district.  From a tourist's standpoint, the 9-11 memorial is nearby, but it's easy to reach that on the subway if you are staying in a more interesting part of the city.  Otherwise the hotel has a number of pros and cons as per the other reviews.  The bed linens are luxurious.  The 25 yard-long pool is nice.  However, the bar is too small and is overcrowded in the afternoon by the business crowd, especially from around 5 PM onward.  The restaurant CUT, as the name implies, is definitely very meat-oriented.  The most unfortunate thing about dining from my viewpoint as a guest, is that the breakfast menu has limited healthy choices (major menu sections are ""Eggs, eggs, eggs"" and ""Flour, butter, sugar.""). The atmosphere of the hotel as a whole feels a little sterile, especially the lobby area.Aside from these general things is the fact that in my case the hotel made a mistake when I combined two separate reservations that I had made due to an alteration in my trip.  While human errors are understandable, the true test of a luxury hotel and especially my expectations from a 4S hotel is how such errors are handled -- in my case very poorly.  I don't want to be more specific, but apparently from other reviews such has been an issue with other guests as well."
0.6479166666666667,0.45833333333333326,"Four Seasons will never disappoint you. The staff is very friendly and helpful from the moment you step by the door making every guest feel welcome and cherished. I want to take this opportunity to send warm regards to Katora at the front desk, Semir (the best concierge) and the lady that heads housekeeping and assisted me.Since I have involved in the luxury hospitality for several years this hotel stands among the best."
0.26421957671957674,0.5664021164021164,"Opportunity to visit for one night to attend a business meeting on the premises. Arrival and check-in was prompt, friendly and highly professional. Staff throughout (front deck, concierge to wait staff) were incredible they were highly attentive, polite and service-oriented. Assigned room (corner room) was luxurious and tastefully decorated. I like the i-pad next to the bed that provided access to a myriad of services, such as ordering room service. Work desk was of a good size and afforded easy access to power outlets. Room was brightly lit and adorned with a variety of amenities expected of this chain. Bed was extremely comfortable. Climate control was responsive and the room lighting could be easily controlled by switches adjacent to the bed.Bathroom was large and came with a walk-in shower and bath tub. As I arrived late, I elected to order room service which arrived promptly - but the food was mediocre. Breakfast at the Cut restaurant provided standard fare. Overall, given its proximity to downtown attractions, this is a wonderful hotel to gain some respite from visiting the city."

Beautiful, spacious rooms with extremely comfortable bedding, and the bathroom was incredibly large with a deep tub for soaking while taking in a skyline view.  The service was impeccable, from front desk services to housekeeping.  And the third floor pool was terrific for children, as it ranged from 3.5 to 4 feet deep.We very much felt like celebrities while staying at the Four Seasons.  And in fact we even met one, as celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck was in the elevator with us one evening!  (One of his restaurants is located in the hotel.)  For a high end NYC stay, you cannot do better than this hotel."

We normally stay in Central Park/Bryant Park area but find ourselves in Soho most of the time.  Instead of spending all our time on the train we decided to stay closer to Soho.  The hotel is brand new and feels brand new.  Easy to walk to many places and also many subway connects possible.  We had an amazing stay and the Four Seasons made our anniversary very special.  Whenever possible we stay at Four Seasons due to the world class customer service.  Speaking of which Brett at the front desk was the best.  He remembered our names and our special occasion and we would stop to say hi whenever we passed by the front desk.  Team members like Brett are the reason we stay at Four Seasons.  We will be back.

Having stayed in Uptown, Midtown and Downtown, this would be my first choice. The Four Season is a stylish hotel with superior service and attention to detail and providing every comfort for their guests. The rooms are welcoming, offering a cosy retreat from the pace of Manhattan. The bathrooms are lovely with generous, high quality toiletries.

We were also welcomed with an incredible surprise bottle of Pinot Noir from the Front Desk Manager, Alex Warren. What an amazing young man. He came and greeted us, spoke to us about our plans and made wonderful suggestions for the day. He even suggested that I layer (we are NOT used to the cold weather) and thank God he did because it was a lifesaver! He talked to us about our thoughts on the Broadway Show, Hamilton. Some other names that were memorable and kind people are Samir, Raul and Jason.

0.2663392857142857,0.6150595238095239,"What a fabulous hotel.  A Great attentive staff.  Beautiful room that was a very good size for NYC.  Love the tile work and marble in the bathroom. Decor is understated and modern.  pool & spa area were very nice.  Great doormen and great smell in the hotel.  Great beds and the rooms are quiet.  Nice little touches too for example we left glasses in the room and they left Four Seasons glasses wipes after housekeeping came.  The only complaint I could think of is at the bar there is a constant cold wind blasting in from the lobby due to poor design.  Overall I would definitely stay again as you can find good prices on the weekends since the WTC area is slow on the weekends, but nothing is very far on the subway.  I loved this hotel."

My room was wonderful, very large by NYC standards and a perfect retreat. I loved the bathroom - the bathtub was especially amazing and the spa concierge kindly gave me a salt and rose petal soak for it when I mentioned I was excited to use it. I cannot day enough about the staff and the quality of my stay.  This hotel is one of my favorites now and I will be back."

Great lighting and atmosphere throughout the hotel -  crack the window open and listen to the hustle and bustle. Super large bathtub and good size rooms. The only complaint Id have would be the sheets felt starchy - would be nice to have the same quality of sheets as other four seasons. Overall was terrific a terrific stay. Adra at the front desk was amazing - got a reservation at a restaurant which we had the best seat in the house along with complimentary Moet champagne - not too shabby... "
0.2747942386831275,0.442798353909465,"Stayed for 5 nights. First night was on 7 th floor i believe while rest of the nights were on 22nd. (They changed room on my request as earlier one didnt have a bath tub as it was accessible room.Anyhow i liked their breakfasts and service. The doormen were great. Liked the full service gym with weights and machines unlike some hotels which have a basic gym carrying treadmills etc. Pool is okay too (roughly 1.5m) and so are the locker rooms. What they can do best is not give you room on the side where the housekeeping entrance doors are. As they housekeeping guys keep coming and going you may be disturbed. Its okay if u arent bothered i was a bit, but didn't bother changing room as i came in late from office and fell asleep quickly.There was a false fire alarm which woke me up on last night and they were great in putting the last days breakfast on three house. Overall a great experience as it was in Manhattan and v close to WTC and ground zero. Century 21 is opposite the Occulus too. So all this nearby. Walk a few hundred metre to wall street as well to see the fearless girl statue and the raging bull on broadway.Closest station is Chalmers st i guess. Good restaurants on Greenwich street nearby. There is a Barnes n Noble too down the road nearby.Sharing picture that i took of a sunset from Greenwich street building and also another on wall street. My room didnt have much of a view as it was in street but room was well lit with sunlight. It was a big room i must admit.Pictures are copyrighted :)"

0.3852941176470588,0.5870588235294116,"We chose this hotel for a quick business trip to the city owing to the hotel's proximity to our client's offices. I have previously stayed at the FS in the UES, which I also like a lot.This is a glossy, gorgeous and rather ""hip"" hotel (though I dare say describing anything as hip probably isn't). The decor fits the area and the young, dynamic feel. I'd say this feels more like a business than tourist hotel because of its location and sophistication..I took rather a lot of photos of the lobby area as the natural stone pillars and the artworks are stunning. We stayed a week before Christmas  the hotel looked fashionably festive and the bar was buzzing.We met friends for dinner in the Wolfgang Puck restaurant - we had an excellent meal with superb service, whilst admiring the Tracey Emin artwork.We stayed in a Gotham Suite - really liked the peace on the top floor and the suite layout.Early breakfast the next day was serene and very different from the previous night's freneticism. A great start to a successful trip.I plan to return."
0.3814935064935065,0.5754329004329004,It’s the best hotel in manhattan. Just for the record there’s 2 Four-seasons hotels in manhattan. The reason why I choose this one (Downtown Manhattan) it’s due to its closeness to broadway st where I can buy cheap stuff on sale specially on feb nyc fashion week plus vintage stores and coffee shops are everything to me! I hope the message is crystal clear now! Their spa is amazing for stressful busniess trips to nyc. The breakfast is okay I only had avotoast so I can’t really know! Free coffee in lobby in the morning! I love nyc 
0.2334285714285714,0.49050000000000005,"Our family of four wile visiting from Australia stayed here for a week. The accommodation we selected was a one bedroom suite (similar cost to two standard rooms) which we were very happy with. The two children slept on a sofa that folded out into a bed. During the day, housekeeping returned it to a sofa then remade the bed each night, so this provided us flexibility.The quality of the room - was high, as you would expect from a Four Seasons Hotel. I suspect it must have been recently refurbished.Reception / Concierge - top notch, nothing was too much trouble and always able to assist.Doormen - brilliant, even when it's freezing outsideQuality of the reception / foyer area - appeared recently refurbished.Pool - brilliant.We would next hesitate recommending this hotel.Cost - It's not cheap, but it's a very high end hotel in NYC, so nothing's going to be cheap."
0.24960317460317458,0.5915674603174603,"We stayed for three nights in the Hudson Suite to celebrate my birthday. I wanted to stay somewhere nice, but less bustling/crowded, as NYC can get during the holidays, and the NYC Downtown was perfect for that.During arrival, the front desk wished me a happy birthday, but told us our room was not ready yet, so they took our bags and we had a drink and some food at the CUT restaurant by Wolfgang Puck. Food was good, and the ambiance was nice - had a better than average selection of liquors. 4pm had come and gone, and our room still wasn't ready. The front desk apologizes, and told me she would personally go with the housekeeping manager to check on the room. We had some complimentary hot chocolate, which was thick yet creamy and not too sweet, and within a few minutes, I was told our room was ready, and we were shown to the elevators.The Hudson Suite is quite large for a NYC hotel room. The standalone soaking tub filled pretty quickly, and could easily fit me and my partner (I am 6'3'' and she is 5'10, so that was pretty impressive). I have to say, it was incredibly relaxing to watch TV while drinking champagne in the tub.The spa was on the smaller side, and only had a steam room (not hot tub) and indoor lap pool (no poolside service). At one point, there were 5 of us crammed into a steam room that could only fit 3 people comfortably, so I left. Cannot adjust the amount of steam/heat in the steam room.Housekeeping was excellent, and very thorough and detailed. I was really hungover one day, and kept calling for complimentary water, and after I think my 3rd request (the bottles are incredibly small, maybe around 6 oz bottles), they sent up an entire case of 24 bottles, free of charge.We came back to a nice spread of chocolates and desserts one night, set up on our dining room table. We ordered room service once, which didn't take too long, but I remember thinking how weird it was that the cheese and charcuterie platter did not come with any bread or crackers.Since my partner was not feeling well the day that we were planning on leaving, we asked to extend our stay another day - the front desk was able to speak to their manager, and gave us another night's stay at the same price we booked at originally, which was much appreciated."

0.08132953963599125,0.5193439580133129,"The one stars is given for the high quality of amenties provided, the location of the hotel and the rooms were well-appointed. Absolutely heavenly bed, considering replacing the ones at my own home. The in-room dinning lunch and breakfast was also delicious. But now let’s talk about your staff. I only had two positive interactions with your staff, one was with the check-in staff member at around 2pm on the 25th. I forgot her name. She was genuinely helpful and courteous. She was of African American heritage. She gave me the impression I was really going to enjoy my stay. She explained all the benefits of being part of the Fine Hotel & Resorts program from Amex. The other positive interaction was with Brittany when she was there to help reset the elevators to the guest rooms as there was a false alarm. I showed and joked with her how everytime I stay at a Four Seasons, some type of alarm always goes off. This would have been an absolutely amazing 5 star + review for your hotel if not for the following series of events that has occurred during and after my stay at your establishment. Every other interaction with your other staff was negative and corncerning. Everything started going downhill after I requested some slippers and dental kit through the in-room iPad. I only realized there were already slippers inside the closet after they were delivered. I left the unused ones in the room. But ever since this delivery took place. Wether it’s your butlers who helped delivered the in-room dinning meals or the card left on the side of my door. Because I had a privacy sign on, I didn’t need the evening turn-down service. The card said your staff reserves the right to visually inspect the room to ensure the well-being of your guests every 24 hours and as well as making sure there were no damages done to the room. I just couldn’t help but feel like I was being investigated for having ‘invisible’ unregistered guests in my room. Your staff were poking their heads through the door to snoop. When the water was delivered, when my brunch was delivered this morning. Your staff was looking around the room whilst asking me if there would be anyone else joining me. Then there was the second incident this afternoon which could be related back to your team’s highly creative imagination being concerned with the state of the room because I have ‘invisible’ guests hiding somewhere. As I had requested the guaranteed 4PM late check out at check in. I arrived back at the hotel at 3:15 PM, planned to leave the hotel at 3:30 PM. I had a flight to catch, it leaves JFK at 8 PM tonight. there was a false fire alarm so  the elevators had to be reset. I waited for that to happen and actually enjoyed the experience because of Brittany. I went up to my floor to find my room key stopped working. I went down to the front desk to get the keys reset. The front desk staff pretended to reset my room’s key card. Gave me a new key and even at this time as I am obviously there to get my things to check out. She asks if I needed one or two keys. I am checking out. Why would I need two keys?!!!!!!! I went upstairs and SURPRISE! The key card doesn’t work. At this point I was starting to get annoyed. I used the phone in the elevator lobby to get a staff to come to my room to open my door for me. I waited several minutes and nobody showed up. I had to go downstairs myself to get the very same agent to open the door for me. She did not apologize, she shrugs and says “ I will come help you I guess. Since I am going upstairs anyway.” Another front office agent noticed she has seen me a couple of times going up and the lifts and reached out to offer help and take me to my room. The agent told her it’s fine. I will go. When we got to my floor, there was an older man from the security department waiting for me. He popped his head through as well to investigae the conditions of the room. I did not have a f*ck’n party in your hotel room. I do not have any invisible guests in my room.  The third incident, as she gave me the non-working room keycard. I asked her nicely to get me a taxi to JFK in about 10 minutes. Her response was ‘We don’t do that for our guests anymore. Guests are always late so you can request one yourself when you are actually downstairs.’ I was shocked. Then the saga continues as I was checking out. My mind was on getting to the airport on time and just signed the folios as they were handed to me and requested a taxi. I thought everything was finally over and I can bid your hotel goodbye and continue my search for a to go to hotel in NYC. Sadly your front desk staff’s ability to cause more unnecessary drama and harassment is able to reach me 35,000 feet in the air. On my way to Vegas. Congratulations to them. Bravo. They have altered my brunch bill as a lunch bill. Even though I had ordered exclusively from the breakfast menu for my brunch today placed well before noon. They did not use my daily $100 breakfast credit.  They sent me a new bill. Could you please help me fix this? Your staff needs to be retrained on manners."

The room is very comfortable and beautiful pictures do it not justice.I celebrated my bday there and was sent a cute dessert! Pool was heated ! Did not do any spa services but after the pool I went to use the steam room and Was invited to use their relaxation room and have a delicious tea.Food here is very expensive! I ordered a kids chicken finger w fries and an apple juice and it was $56 dollars included service charge and $5 gratuity! Crazy right?!breakfast was delicious! When we stay in a hotel  on our birthdays they usually send few things extra to celebrate your birthday but here I had a feeling they were a little cheap! For an example if you stay in a park hyatt they even send you a bottle of champagne ,at the ritz they send you a basket of chocolates but here just a cute little dessert! I have stayed in other four seasons where they go above and beyond.Just a little detail to the management! We feel appreciated with lil things like that.Overall a great stay!

The hotel does not operate its own restaurant, but Wolfgang Puck's ""Cut"" is on the property and the food, service and atmosphere were all truly superb.  Of course, the hotel does provide room service, and our meals were unfailingly punctual and deliciously well-prepared.The general manager, Mr. Thomas Carreras, is to be commended for leading a team that exudes exceptional personality, obvious intelligence, and a commitment to excellence in hospitality, and they are as efficient and effective in their respective positions as they are charming.This is one of the most accomplished and commendable FS properties within their highly regarded portfolio."

After that a sauna in the shower room. Went out for dinner--but have been to Cut restaurant before and it is truly first class. In the mornings I ordered room service from the convenient ipad and it arrived quickly. The next day had room service for lunch--and it was outstanding.

Rooms are large for New York, huge bathrooms but only one sink and an enormous shower but it only has one head and no bench. Room for two people but one of you is going to freeze while the other is under the water. The mattress was very soft, in our opinion, but we requested the firm topper be added and that helped tremendously. We found the room quiet and comfortable. Honestly, the service at this hotel is just a bit subpar for a FS. We had issues with in room dining and housekeeping and a major issue with the servicing of our private bar that wasn’t corrected fully when we addressed it and then the same issue occurred the following day. We adore the FS brand,as they do an impeccable job of anticipating your next need/want but this property was a miss for us. We wouldn’t return.  "
0.42857142857142855,0.6,"The hotel is in a great location for any activities in Lower Manhattan. Service, decor, amenities, floorplans are all wonderful. The service quality in the Spa, however, was disappointing. Excellent hotel to explore the ""city that never sleeps"", therefore, not so great if you want to unwind before your next urban exploration..."
0.26686868686868687,0.6014141414141414,"We arrived after a lackluster stay in midtown--having booked a last minute rate, which included breakfast and a food and beverage credit. We were immediately upgraded to a massive suite, albeit without a view. The suite was among the most comfortable rooms we've stayed in while in New York, and the staff and service were excellent, with perhaps the exception of the breakfast--which was fine, but not overwhelming. We found this to be a quiet and comfortable hotel, near all the subway lines, and with decent neighborhood amenities in an easy walk. We would stay here again--assuming we could get a good deal, as we did on this last stay."
0.3927083333333333,0.5791666666666666,"Room was clean, comfortable, well-maintained.  Friendly service.  Excellent location, not too busy on the streets at night, quiet downtown area.  Spa is amazing.  Well worth the money and would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
0.2853463203463203,0.543152533740769,"This is a great hotel if you're staying downtown. The rooms are well appointed with very comfortable beds. I find most NYC hotels very noisy but this hotel is very quiet. I've stayed here twice and both times the room was very large for a New York City hotel. Bathrooms are quite spacious with a large tub and separate shower.Despite the size of the rooms, there aren't great seating options--couch/chairs are small.  However, I don't spend a ton of time in the room when I'm in town so not an issue for me.There are a lot of modern amenities in the room such as lighting/curtains/tv in bathroom mirror.The staff is friendly and hotel is very clean. Overall a great option, but not cheap."
-0.003652703505644674,0.4512774806892454,"After a horrible experience at the Atlanta Four Seasons Hotel, where my family and I unknowingly stayed at the hotel while they were hosting a VIP event and we were walking from the hotel lobby to the hotel restraint when the security person approached me and told me I was not welcome upstairs where the restaurant was and I was not welcome in the hotel as he though were not guest of the hotel.  After the front desk manager then failed to confirm we were staying at the hotel and resolve the situation I contacted the president’s office of the Four Season and received a gift card to be used for another visit.  We decided to visit NY City for my birthday and stay at the new Downtown location.  Upon making reservation on the 22nd of September I forwarded the e-mail from the presidents office and was told I needed to sort that out after arriving at the hotel… which left me a bit puzzled and aggravated after thinking about it..We arrived early and decided to eat at Cut restaurant while we waited for our room to be ready.  We were pleasantly surprised when the room was ready early.The hotel is located close to the 9/11 Memorial, which was very nice to visit.  After a bit of sight seeing we came back to our room I called housekeeping for a couple of very minor items, which took almost 30 minutes for someone to come to our room.. possibly they are very busy and understaffed.  We tried to fall asleep but their must have been a party in one of the rooms close by.. so I contacted the management to see if they could help bring the noise level down, which quieted after 12:30am.. however, we then heard 12 doors close by slamming between 12:30 and 2:15.. finally at 6:30am I asked the hotel staff if there is any reason it was so noisy where we were sleeping and she said she would share my concerns with management.Needless to say we did not feel refreshed when we got up and went for breakfast… as we were greeted by about 20 firemen from the Bomb Squad in the morning as we went into the lobby.  After another day of sightseeing we returned to the hotel and it smelt like something was burning in or close to our room.  I called and reported the issue and was told security would check it out… after waiting about 20 minutes I called back and was told “other guest complained about the same thing and security said the smell was caused by the fumes of Cut restaurant...”  First, I would have appreciated someone calling me back to find that out instead of me having to call back to let me know instead of sitting there thinking I am going to wait until I get comfortable thinking we may have to move to another room or someone was going to come look at our room to investigate as we were originally told..  needless to say, we got another bad night sleep and couldn’t wait to leave..When I got home and checked the bill that was e-mailed to me the e-mail that I forwarded from the Four Seasons President was not honored so I paid the amount in full.If I were to visit NY City and stay at a Four Seasons again, I would stay at the one closer to Central Pak as we found that one much friendlier and more hospitable.  I would have given this hotel 1 star but found the doorman consistently helpful and also appreciated the lifeguard at the pool."

A block from 9/11 museum and close to Brooklyn Bridge, Lower East Side and Soho.Cannot fault the hotel at all.Outstanding accommodation and service. You get what you pay for!!Room completely soundproof. Spacious room and bathroom.A new favourite of ours."
0.3992592592592592,0.5155555555555555,Beautiful hotel and exceptional service! The rooms are gorgeous and very modern. The location was perfect for a short business trip in the financial district. I can’t wait to find an excuse to go back! 
0.425,0.575,This is what I expect from a truly top notch hotel. I can’t think of anything the room lacked and the standards were world class. A true oasis in the city. Can’t wait to return. Kudos to the personable and caring staff. 
0.10876033057851239,0.43283746556473823,"The wife and I had some flight issues that kept us from getting out of JFK. Since we had the entire next day we decided we would stay downtown. We've stayed at the Four Seasons up in Midtown, and thought to check out this one in the financial district. Boy are we glad we did! Shou tout to our travel agent, Richie at WhataHotel for getting us a last minute reservation! We arrived around 1:30 in the morning to smiling faces at the door and in the lobby. I had ordered some food via room service while en route to the hotel and it arrived at our room shortly after check-in. Rooms are brand spankin new, views are fantastic, the bathrooms are spacious and well appointed. If you're looking for the shopping, definitely stay up in midtown, but if you're considering a stay on the other end, highly recommend you consider making FSNY Downtown home for your stay."

We absolutely loved the hotel! So classy, elegant and understated. Extremely confortable and a nice base to do all we needed. Room service was quite good although we found prices a bit high. A magnificent option."
0.21500000000000002,0.5549999999999999,"Our son goes to college in NYC, so when we come to visit this is our home base.  The hotel is fantastic, the rooms are good sized and the service is amazing.  A tip - if you have the platinum AMEX card, book through them as you get guaranteed late checkout at 4 pm, a credit for $100 a day for breakfast and a stay credit of $100 you can use anytime.  Room service is any menu item you want 24 hrs a day, which means brunch for dinner!  it is very close to the brooklyn bridge and the freedom tower, so plenty to do.  the doormen are great at helping with directions and tips.  We head back next week for stay number 2 of many!"
0.34465277777777775,0.543888888888889,"We loved the concept which is a bit different than the typical Four Seasons city hotels that have big lobby bar restaurants, terraces etc. FS Downtown is very modern and private and feels like having your own serviced penthouse suite in Manhattan. They dont have their own restaurants, there is the steak restaurant CUT by Wolfgang Puck inside the property where you can get also breakfast and lunch or evening drinks but thats about it. So we usually went for breakfast some coffee places around the block.We tested CUT restaurant for their hyped steak and had a great experience.Other than that you have your room with bathtubs and amazing beds and great city views and also a fitness center with big 23meter long swimming pool facing the city and spa on the 3rd flloor. Ive had many massages but have to say this was hands down the best massage in my life. My bf booked one also with the same therapist and loved it. Very experienced therapist and also their massage beds are heated during the treatment which made me almost fall asleep soo relaxing!Great experience, loved the design everything in bright colors and amazing service, would love to return any time!I would recommend FS downtown for couples or families who love to explore the city, anyone on business trip who likes to relax after work with a little wellness and interior design lovers."

Also, the staff is helpful. There is a bar downstairs with restaurant which is decent and tasty. There are many attractions near. The World Trade Center memorial was across the street. Great location with the mall near. The rooms are extremely luxury with wonderful service. If you need something newer & a place that meets all the 5 star luxury requirements please stay here! "

0.2627777777777778,0.7122222222222222,I stayed at the hotel while visiting a friend who lives nearby. I probably wouldn't stay here if my sole purpose was to see Broadway shows or see museums because that is all too far away and would cost a lot in taxis and ubers.Staff was refreshingly friendly.  Hotel is very near 9/11 Memorial. Spa was fantastic.  I highly recommend the spa if you stay there.  I'm happy there was coffee in the room. The only thing I didn't like was how some of the street light came in through the bathroom window at night.

0.3146759259259259,0.5326234567901235,"We loved every minute of our stay. Blocks away from 9/11 memorial and quick access to subway at chamber st. Easy car service as well off a little quieter one way street than some other hotels. We arrived early and were able to get early check-in which made the 1st day much easier being able to shower and change after flights. Quality of beds and rooms are spectacular, but it’s four seasons so it’s what you expect. The spa and fitness area were excellent. Amazing customer service with a minor room service issue we had but it was resolved promptly. Everyone greeted us with a smile and always tried to make sure we knew where we were heading in case we needed help leaving the hotel each day. Would highly recommend and will be back!"
-0.31428571428571433,0.6398412698412698,The room was average. The bed and pillows uncomfortable and the service was very poor. This hotel is definitely not a five star hotel but charges prices of a five star hotel.I will never fo back to this hotel. I’m not sure i will ever book a four seasons again after this very disappointing experience.

The Tribeca suites was sheer heaven. I can't say enough about the perfection of this hotel. The restaurant Cut was excellent. It was to leave this dream hotel. I can't wait to return.
0.3587310606060606,0.6273674242424244,"We stayed here in August 2018 and it was a very pleasant stay. The rooms are spacious and clean. The decor is new and modern. The rest of the hotel is also modern, opulent and clean. To go up to the room you have to scan your key card. They provide espresso in room. The half and half was coagulated but they’re quick to respond with requests. We had a couples massage at the spa and that was wonderful. The spa is clean with a steam room showers, lockers, hair dryer etc. The pool is huge and beautiful. They were working on the men’s bathroom though and my husband could use it to his satisfaction.The spa resting lounge was serene and they had teas and snacks available. The hotel is a minute’s walk to 9/11 memorial pools, the Westfield mall, Eataly and the Chambers subway station. All in all a lovely stay."
0.32575757575757575,0.6863636363636364,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit.  After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons.  It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park.  However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations.  They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room.  The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs).  My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area."

Our corner room was super quiet, with a beautiful (and large) bathroom and enough closets for a long stay.The bar downstairs serves some very nice drinks, mixed by attentive staff.The front desk service was prompt and personable. A nice feature is that hotel contacted us by SMS to inquire about arrival time to make sure the room was ready.Overall, a very pleasant experience. "
0.12698529411764706,0.39294117647058824,we love four seasons hotels but this one cannot make up its mind what it is.  it is not a tourist hotel as there are very few services and the restaurant such as it is and the bar close at 10.30pm!  the city that never sleeps is a joke because very little else is open after then in the area.  So it was explained they were in a business district - next day when i asked for the business centre they said they do not have one!!! the room cleaning was ok but every day we had a glass missing or a coffee cup missing and we had to call for one every time!  on one occasion we were asked to wait til next morning!we reserved the room til 4pm on our departure date but despite no disturb notice staff came in twice before we left trying to make up room - poor comms within the staffsadly lots of little things add up to us saying stay elsewhere for over 400 a night and you will get much better service and attention.really four seasons can do better than this - try Hong Kong which is great.the good side was the proximity to the metro and the lower Manhattan areas including the wall street and 911 areas.big thumbs up for Brooklyn Bridge for that morning run and just over it the River Cafe where we had our anniversary dinner was excellent.
0.43239113827349124,0.628418640183346,"This is my favorite place to stay in NYC. As a new hotel, the comfort and luxury are top notch. Service here is excellent - maybe best of any Four Seasons I’ve experienced. For Manhattan, the rooms are large and the bathrooms wonderful. Bed is incredibly comfortable. Windows open, which is always nice for fresh air. Only complaint is the restaurant. Could be much better quality, but service is good. Will be back! "
0.20586124401913874,0.3546251993620414,"We have always stayed in Midtown on our visits to NYC. We thought this would be a good time to try Downtown and it could not be any better. The hotel is of course new and it feels it. It is modern in design but still old fashioned Four Seasons service. The rooms are impeccable and extremely well maintained. You are greeted with a smile and hello at every contact with staff. Front Desk, In Room Dining, SPA, are all well staffed and professional and engaging. The beds and pillows are so comfortable. There was no noise in our rooms on 16th floor and 15th floor. We actually came back for a second visit just a few weeks after our first. To get up to Theatre District and Midtown allow 20+ minutes by Uber or E Train on Blue Line. While downtown, check out Tribeca, SOHO, and the Trade Center Memorials. There are many things to do downtown and if you go, this is the place to stay. Don't let the location stop you. This is truly a 5 Star Hotel."
0.5097402597402598,0.6240491651205938,Spending 3 nights at the newish Four Seasons downtown was spectacular.  The understated elegance was simple and wonderful.  The 2 most memorable things were the incredible bathroom (the best I have ever experienced) and the genuine smiles from everyone at the property.  The things I had forgotten were things that I would have missed had they not happened.  The staff were there to help us with personal details and events that made our trip run smoothly and efficiently.  We were able to relax as well as enjoy all that New York had to offer.

Check-in was efficient - I had checked in online and everything was ready for me as soon as I arrived.Rooms were bright and comfortably furnished, and the hotel is very quiet and it does provide a calming ambience.  Amenities were of excellent quality and the bed was comfortable.Service was efficient and professional - the only downside is that the location is somewhat difficult to hail a cab, although the staff were very helpful in getting one for me in a timely manner."
0.44393939393939397,0.740909090909091,"Four Seasons downtown is my favorite place to stay in New York City when visiting.  The services excellent, the facilities and room was tremendous.  The level of service was consistent with that of the Four Seasons and beyond."
0.07114814814814815,0.4841851851851852,"First, the hotel is located so it is impossible to hail a cab in a timely manner.  The doormen are no assistance.  If you are on a schedule, arrange alternate transportation, which is exactly what I did.  But it was a waste of money.  Additionally, the streets in that area are a rabbit warren, so many of them are blocked off permanently.  The room was not made-up when we returned to the hotel.  It was almost 5pm.  We ordered room service twice.  There are two of us registered in the room.  Yet, they only brought one place setting and one napkin each time we had room service.  Additionally, despite asking for tap water twice, we never received it.  Finally, the food came about 90% correct.  Most functions are controlled by a computer pad.  First, if you leave it plugged in during the night it is brighter than a night light.  (And there are already way too many small dots of light around the room controlling various things, making the room too bright for sleep.)  Second, it gives you the ability to control many functions and activities.  But it is very confusing.  There are too many menus that are not intuitive.  Additionally, while ordering room service on it, I ordered a drink, then we decided to get a second.  But it would not let me back to the drink screen.  I finally did it by erasing our order and starting again. It was very frustrating.  Meanwhile, the closet is not tall enough.  When using a hanger with clips on it to allow slacks to hang down (it eliminates creases), my pants wound-up on the floor.  I'm six feet tall.  There are plenty of people taller than me.   They had the space.   It's just poorly designed.  Finally, the toilet was stuffed-up."
0.41658730158730156,0.6069841269841271,"The staff were superior in every way - helpful, thoughtful, polite, friendly.  Service was astonishingly good with everyone I encountered - the doormen, the concierge, the room service folks. Everyone was incredibly welcoming. The Four Seasons is well-known as a luxury hotel - this particular one was somehow more special.  (Tell the architect/designer the tile work in the bathroom was fantastic - beautifully done).  Bathroom amenities were thoughtful and more than met my needs.  Only one recommendation: alert guests to existence and location of the hand-held hose nozzle for deep soaking tub."
0.4785714285714286,0.6607142857142856,The Four Season have mastered how to make me and my family feel special in every aspect of our stay.  We enjoyed ourselves.  My kids loved the room service.  Thank you front desk for making us feel absolutely special.  We will be returning.

0.26796536796536796,0.5270923520923521,"Thoroughly enjoyed. We booked a Four Seasons Executive Suite for a one night pre-cruise stay in the Big Apple for our family of 4. And while midtown is usually a location we prefer, we wanted the commute to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal to be as easy as possible the next day. This fit the bill perfectly. Upscale accommodations but tasteful and not unnecessarily flashy. Also roomy for a family. My wife and I had the bedroom while the kids occupied the unusually large sofa bed in the living room (almost a king?). Bathroom is really large. And the Four Seasons team had a nice surprise for us with pop corn, local soda and a free movie. Nice touch. Going to Brooklyn took less that 30 minutes on the Friday morning. We'll return for sure. Maybe I'd ask for a higher floor next time. We were on the 9th floor and facing ventilation equipment of another building. Did not keep us from a good night but could have been quieter. But small thing, really enjoyed."

The staff (at check-in, at the spa, at the pool, at etc.) were professional, but friendly and helpful.  The lap pool was clean and had a great view.  The gym stocked energy bites and flavored waters, had new equipment, and was kept pleasantly cool.  My room was a standard room but seemed large and had a private bar.  The bathroom was spacious with a great layout.  I can't say enough good things about the bed - possibly the best sleep I've gotten in ages.  I plan to spend many more nights here."

0.2350181405895691,0.5409342403628117,"Who wants to stay midtown anyway?  Crowds of mouth-breathing tourists, traffic snarls that take forever to drive through, crazy people wandering the sidewalks muttering about conspiracies in the Water Department.  No, thanks.The Downtown Four Seasons, like its sister hotel midtown, is flawless.  If you've got business to do midtown, you need to stay up there.  But if you are visiting a child who goes to NYU and flew into Newark, it's the best thing to do.  It's more quiet, it's near great restaurants in Tribeca, it's near Soho and the Village.It is very near the federal building and the WTC.  This cuts both ways.  Some people don't want to be around there due to inchoate concerns about terrorists.  Others want to be close to the shopping and memorials etc.  It's really a question of probabilities and risk tolerance, when you get right down to it.Enough about location.  The people at the Four Seasons can't do enough for you.  They greet you, they are unobtrusively omnipresent (is that a thing?), and when you ask them to do something for you, they do it well before you expect it to be done.The rooms are clean and well cared for.  The housekeeping service and the valet service is excellent.  Friendly and efficient, even for special needs.The restaurant is nice, had a weeks worth of breakfasts and one dinner there.  The hosts are welcoming and they remember you from one day to the next.The health club is good, the swimming pool is not too hot (like many hotels) and not too much chlorine.  But here is where you get a DQ* or two:  There is only one shower in the health club/spa area for each locker room.  That's kind of weird.  And, it would be helpful to put up lane lines in the pool due to waves, but these are merely quibbles.Stay here and enjoy.  Avoid hanging out with people who talk loudly.  Don't accept presents from strangers, particularly if they are wooden horses.  Breath deeply when under stress.  *Dimmy Quibble"

EVERYBODY knew the entire weekend that we were there for my birthday and kept making sure we had a great time!  Personalized service from early check in (10:00am) to late check out 1:00pm, to a birthday cake in my room upon check in, to excellent concierge service and doormen who were friendly and knowledgable, not to mention very clean cut and exceptionally presentable!  The hotel itself was amazing with everything from the great smelling lobby, to the amazing pool and the extremely clean and comfortable guest room.  The location of the hotel was more than we could have hoped for!  We always stay in Midtown but this time chose to change it up and stay downtown.  We were not disappointed in the least.  The Four Seasons is only two blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge, right next to the World Trade center and Oculus, a couple of blocks from the historic Financial District, a short walk to Tribeca and SOHO, Battery and Wagner Parks.  And when we did go to Midtown or Chelsea the subway was only across the street and a few stops later we were where we needed to be!  I can not say enough about our experience at this hotel!!!  By far one of our best trips to New York!  Will definitely come back and stay here!!!"
0.5567187499999999,0.7796875,"A wonderful hotel with wonderful staff.Great room with every facility one could require.  Great shower and huge bathtub, both with excellent water pressure. A very comfortable bed with luxuriating pillows.Great breakfasts and excellent room service but best of all is the staff.  Not one can be singled out as each one was friendly, efficient and effective.   I wish I could have employed any of them when I ran my own business a few years ago.The location worried me a little when I was planning this trip, but it turned out to be excellent, with lots to walk to and only moments from the subway system.   Walking in Manhattan is faster than travelling by taxi and you get to burn off the calories consumed from the yummy blueberry pancakes at breakfast.To the entire team : THANK YOU."

The property itself is alive and full of treasures (very nice rooms, full-sized pool, fantastic gym, good bar), with close proximity to almost anything one would want. But the real difference maker is the FSD team.  The staff is warm, inviting, willing to do most anything - genuine and real ""people"""

0.29496603970741897,0.65258658008658,"Quick summary: The wedding itself was a bit busy (as all weddings are if you're in the wedding party), but my husband and I returned home feeling refreshed and rejuvenated from our delightful stay here. We cannot recommend this place enough! We are now a bit ruined thanks to our amazing stay here and will have trouble enjoying anywhere as much.Details:Staying here at the Four Seasons was absolutely magical! My husband and I stayed here as wedding guests from Sunday until Tuesday, but we felt like we were on our own honeymoon because we were so pampered and spoiled by the Four Seasons team. Everyone was absolutely lovely here, especially the room service and spa team members. If marrying in NYC, I simply cannot imagine a better place than the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown to serving as your wedding venue and a place for your wedding group to stay at. The hotel and its amenities are fantastic, but the people here are even more fantastic and wonderful. They truly go above and beyond to ensure your stay is magical. I can only hope that the team is treated as well by the Four Seasons management as we guests are treated by the team. The team definitely deserves it!Room service - the food was delicious, but more than that, the people who delivered the food were the absolute best. Very professional and competent, yet gracious, friendly, kind, and o so helpful. We couldn't get the wrinkles out of my husband's tuxedo and needed it in an hour for wedding photos. When breakfast was delivered, my husband (finally) inquired if there was any way possible to press the tuxedo jacket within an hour. She said, ""we'll try"", and wow, it was amazing! Crisis averted. I really wish I could remember everyone's names, but I was unfortunately too tired to remember due to the busy wedding. Spa - if you are fear getting your nails done professionally due to being a germphobe, the spa here is the place to come to. The front desk team is exceptionally kind (I wish I remembered her name, but I don't. She was soooo lovely and nice!). My brother and I received our manicures and pedicures from Nyla. She is the absolute best! We were with her in a serene spa room from 1:30 until 4 pm, and the time literally flew by because she was so pleasant, professional, kind, and charming. Nyla is such a conscientious manicurist/artist that you know you don't need to worry about germs at all. Before her, I hated (and avoided) receiving manicures and pedicures due to past experiences elsewhere. After her, I will continue to avoid manicures and pedicures unless I receive them from her. No one else. Nyla is the manicurist who likely has a cult following with clients who will follow her wherever she goes. The absolute best!"
0.17319347319347322,0.5530594405594406,"The Four Seasons Downtown seems still a bit undiscovered. It offers great Four Seasons service. The rooms are spacious and modern equipped with technology that actually is easy to use and saves time. (Sometimes room  technology is almost impossible to figure. Oh well, I will just sleep with the lights on.). The staff is great- friendly and accommodating in every way. Price wise it compares favorably to equivalent properties in midtown. I had appointments in midtown and they were easy to get via cab or subway. (The hotel is near a subway hub so you can go really anywhere in the city with ease.). And if are coming from DC or Philly or other points south, I recommend getting off Amtrak at Newark and switching to the Path train to the World Trade Center (super easy to do and the trains run constantly) then get off at the World Trade Center, walk through the beautiful gleaming new Path station and you are a short block from the Four Seasons. No more Penn Station. No more horrible cab lines. Just a great hotel -service and location. And reasonable for what you get. And also near the 9-11 memorial, a must see."

0.3377300657675659,0.6276903596403594,"I am a huge Four Seasons fan and the new FS Downtown is a very modern, clean lined hotel with a wonderful downtown location and a very different look and feel compared to more traditional FS properties. I was checked in early and given a beautiful upgrade to a Gotham Suite, which was room 2408, the highest floor in the hotel. The room had a beautiful view towards the new world trade center oculus and you can see a peak of the river as well. The room was super quiet and had perfect A/C system, as it was extremely hot and humid in NYC the day I stayed. The suite had a lovely layout with a stunning bathroom, a heavenly soaking tub that fills very fast, lovely designer toiletries, huge comfortable towels and robes and mood lighting. A large living area, gorgeous comfortable bed, Nespresso machine, and gorgeous wood floors created a beautiful space. This was incredibly kind of the team to give such a lovely room. Thank you!! I was celebrating an early birthday and they sent a delicious little cake with a card signed from several colleagues of the hotel which was a very nice touch. The in room dining food was delicious- they have beautiful freshly made juices, a very good selection of food and very nice presentation. Just note, the in room dining food prices are incredibly expensive, even by NYC standards. Even if you order 2 items you will likely spend close to $70-$100. Simply something to note. The dining experience though from a room service standpoint is far superior than most hotels. All of the servers were very kind, made nice conversation and arrange the food nicely. Scott in particular was very nice. The lobby has an amazing scent each time you walk in and the friendly doorman are always on hand offering chilled water bottles and opening the very heavy doors. Everyone in the lobby says hello and smiles and makes a point to acknowledge you which is really great. The front desk team was a definite standout, especially Katora. She did my check out and was absolutely delightful, very five star and clearly quite good at her job. Its rare to find especially in NYC hotels. Megan, Enderich, and Alex, the hotels front office manager, are all incredibly kind, warm and polite. I was given a late checkout and the hotel has very smooth service. Maybe not quite on the same level as other seasoned hotels in their group, but everyone is very nice. One flaw to note, regarding turndown service. Nothing major and its just a side note for the executive team to note:- I asked for turndown and it was definitely not the Forbes 5 star standard. I left the room attendant a tip and a note saying thank you. She took the tip and left the note on the bed side table, which is a little offensive, but ok. She did not replenish any of my toiletries and all were running low, the slippers were left in the closet and not set out by the bed on a turndown mat, other Four Seasons will fold your clothing, tie up loose cords with Four Seasons Velcro, arrange your toiletries on a mat, leave a clear plastic bag for your personal items, etc..none of this was done. Trash was left in the bin. Little things, absolutely, but this attention to detail is what sets apart a forbes five star property from a four star property. She also asked me where I wanted the turndown water to be left and if she should have the in room dining tray removed, which I had already finished. The hallways of the rooms are also quite warm. Also, there were 2 sticky patches on the carpet- one near the mini bar rug in the living room and by the window in the bedroom facing towards the oculus. The above did not detract from a spectacular stay, just something to note. I love the hotel and they are doing a great job! They have a young team that is eager and if you want or need to be in this part of the city, its an absolutely amazing choice. Thank you for a wonderful stay! Sincerely, Patrick Winkler"

I don't see value for the price considering its pretty pricey at almost A c-note for a night.consistencies in service vary at this 4  star Hotel without the benefit of dinning. You can go to a less expensive hotel eat at a 4star restaurant and see a Broadway show for less than it costs to spend one night at this hotel.
0.1569307359307359,0.5342111222111222,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference. I was greeted by a friendly staff who even showed me to the elevators and asked if I wanted them to show me the room (no thanks).The room was very plush, with modern decor and very spacious, which is a rare thing among New York hotels. They have bath robes and pair of sleepers and bathroom was oversized to match the room. The view from the room was ok, not spectacular but not fully obscured either (which is often the case in NYC hotels). The elevator was a bit slow in the morning stoping on almost every floor, which was quite annoying being on 22th floor. Hotel lobby is not very big and grand for this class of hotel, but that's more than compensated by relatively large guest rooms. If ther is one complain it is the ergonomics of the coffee making in the room china cabinet are somewhat awkward and feel strangely cramped considering that room itself is quite large. Bedding is super comfy with vault like sound isolation. The location is only ideal if you plan to have most of your activities in downtown (Financial District, 9/11 museum, Battery Park, etc). If you aim for midtown or planning to visit Central Park area landmarks and museums, I would suggest something more uptown."
0.09758841158841158,0.48892840492840495,One night here before cruising  back to the UK. The staff and hotel makes you feel very special without a sense of being over the top. Everthing is of a very high quality while still being subtle and not ostentatious.  We stayed in a Gotham suite. Great bathroom.  Not as big as the suite we had in FS Vancouver the previous night and more expensive. But what else would you expect as this is New York and space is expensive. I would highly recommend if staying in this end of town.

The hotel is not even 2 years old and it just oozes understated luxury and elegance. The rooms are extremely well appointed, very modern, with a large bathroom and the beds are just heavenly.But what really makes the difference in this hotel is the staff!  Every one of them is fantastic and try to make your stay memorable. A special mention to Katora and Alberto from the front desk, you have been amazing, extremely friendly and super helpful and you made us feel like staying at home rather than in an hotel. Thank you! I also thought the location was a good starting point for sightseeing.Thanks as well to Matthew from sales for making us feel so welcome.

To crown it all the concierge was able to secure a reservation for us at POLO BAR, and that was a dream come true. Four seasons never disappoints and i could never imagine staying anywhere else if there is a four seasons in existence."
0.22277310924369748,0.522359943977591,"My wife and I have stayed in this location a few times. The first time we stayed in the Gotham suite with balcony. We stayed in this suite for 5 nights and it was amazing in every sense of the word. The staff is fantastic. Everything in our room was always perfectly maintained the cleaning staff were on top of everything without being on top of us which is key to a wonderful stay for us. We ate breakfast every day from room service and it was always amazing. The second visit was recent on a last minute trip with some friends. We couldnt book the same room. We wound up staying in the premier room. While much smaller and not an amazing view, the room was still large enough for a few nights and had the same great attention and staff. We are sad to say we havent enjoyed the spa or bar in the lobby yet as we have been on the go the entire visit. We plan on coming back and using them one day. The last thing I will say is the location is great not in the middle of a lot going on but not far from it either. This is more of a low key high end area for those wanting to be near tribeca."
0.04645457033388068,0.5995429666119321,"Everything about the hotel and room was excellent... worth the money!.. except for one glaring, and I would say, embarrassing problem. The hot water from the sink in the bathroom produced extremely cloudy water. You can literally see sediments in the water. Cold water was crystal clear, however I was scared to use the hot water. In-fact the level of sediments was extremely high specifically from the sink, however, materially less so from the tub or the shower. I told the front desk and they dispatched maintenance and a manager, Daniel, to investigate.  Daniel informed me that this is how the hot water is in all rooms' sinks... I was surprised and disheartened. I thought I could move to a different room and avoid the issue. However, if all rooms are like this, what is the point? This seems like a fixable issue.. for a hotel of your stature, this is an embarrassing problem... I have trouble recommending this hotel to my parents, much less my co-workers, because the only thing people will remember is the sediments in the hot water. As you know NYC cold water is freezing cold... even mixing in hot water with cold from the sink will clearly show sediments in the water. Please address ASAP. One other unrelated thing, is the height of the curb from the street where guests are dropped off. It is relatively high for folks with somewhat limited mobility. It would be great if the edge of the curb where it gets close to the street is ramped down a little to make stepping up easier. This is otherwise the best hotel I have stayed in in NYC."

Its location is great, given over the past few years of downtown NYC - about couple of blocks away from the Freedom Tower and short walks to FiDi, Battery Park City and Tribeca.  It's about a half-hour walk to NYU / the Village.  The Park Place subway stop is right next to the hotel so very quick to get uptown via express train as well.Our room was spacious, modern and immaculately clean.  We weren't on a high floor but still got nice light and good low-floor NYC views.  The beds (and sofabed) were very comfortable, and the bathroom was spectacular.Service was excellent.  My wife and I had a couple of drinks at the bar, which, amusingly, was a bit of a scene.  My main criticism of the bar was the lack of any simple free bar snacks (no nuts or chips) - everything is on the menu, which seems a little chintzy for such a high-end place.The hotel is quite expensive, though at least when we stayed was less out of line with comparable luxury hotels than the midtown Four Seasons (which also always felt a little too cold and mausoleum-like to me).We're looking forward to returning for future downtown stays."

The bathroom was gigantic and had separate shower and spectacular bathtub that was modern and cool looking.  We decided we wanted to grab a quick, late dinner nearby and someplace that was casual as we were tired from our travels.  Zamir escorted us to a nearby restaurant that was exactly what we were looking for.The next day we order room service for breakfast and it was a selection of pastries and wonderful tea and fantastic coffee.We went to incredible indoor pool that has music playing under the water and then to the spa for Massages.Victor was amazing and it was one of the best massages I ever had.  Afterwards were went to the steam room that was adjacent to the pool.  Lunch consisted of a cheese and charcuterie tray in the room with a nice bottle of champagne.  After a bath in the amazing tub that can fit 2, we headed out for dinner.The next morning the front desk secured out luggage for us until we returned from brunch.  the lady at the desk could not have been nicer and the doorman even wished us a happy anniversary!Stellar service, fantastic rooms and an amazing hotel overall.

My only (slight) criticism is of the restauarant lunch menu. It offered very limited vegetarian options.

Check in was seamless and our room was ready before we even walked into the lobby. Each member of the staff was friendly, professional, and provided excellent service. Everyone knew who we were throughout our entire stay! I was pleasantly surprised how personal our stay was for such a large and busy hotel. The lobby is stunning and inviting. Our room was beautiful. Incredibly comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, and a stunning view of downtown. We were on the 20th floor and the street noise was very minimal. The room layout and amenities made our stay so relaxing that I jokingly began calling our room ""home"". I loved the in-room Ipad, it made everything so easy! We ordered room service each morning from the Ipad and set the time for delivery so we could go workout. The gym was great and it had everything you could need. My mom loved the spa and her massage treatment. The pool is a great amenity and I enjoyed swimming in the morning. I loved that we could specify food allergies or any dietary needs on the Ipad for room service. Hotel room service, even at amazing hotels like the Four Seasons, can sometimes be hit or miss. We ordered room service 4 times, and each time was perfect. Highly recommend their smoothies! Absolutely delicious food and they perfectly accommodated my gluten allergy. We also used the Ipad to book a spa treatment and to ask the concierge to print theater tickets. Again the level of service here is simply wonderful! The location is fantastic for exploring downtown. The quality of the service and the comfort of our stay justified staying downtown, even when half of our plans were in Midtown. It's honestly pretty easy to go to dinner or see a show on Broadway by uber. The subway is conveniently located too, but we decided to use uber instead. We were also celebrating our birthdays during our stay. The hotel wished us a happy birthday. They provided my mom with a mini birthday cake and me with chocolate covered strawberries. A lovely touch. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and we will absolutely be back."

Professional answers and guidance through the whole check-in process, which took 9 seconds.  The rooms are amazing.  I wore their robes and controlled every curtain, tv, room service and light from the iPad remote control thing.  I felt like a rockstar the entire time I was there.  There was a tv built into the mirror in the bathroom.  The beds were so comfy.  Food was amazing, staff was amazing, everything was at the peak at this place."

It exceeded every expectation. The staff was fantastic, friendly, adept at their jobs, and professional.  I told them in advance of my recent marriage and they made accommodations that made my wife and I feel welcomed and special.  I will not forget the service, the attention to detail, or the truly impressive accommodations they had at the Four Seasons Downtown.  We will certainly be back and can’t wait to celebrate here again. "

Usually stay at the Ritz or the Regency and reviewed them some time ago.And then there was the Four Seasons...The moment I walked into the lobby, I had the feeling that this was gonna be good, NO, GREAT.Katora, at the front desk, provided a warm welcome, a verbal tour, and a great room escorted me to the elevator and gave me instructions.  She told me that it was more than pushing a button for my floor.  (I’ll leave that for you to find out...)The room was ample, contemporary furniture, but the bathroom was “killer.”  My measure of a great hotel is the shower.  This one was a walk-in and incredible.  There was a frosted glassed-in throne room and a free standing tub in which you’d have to tread water.The only thing I was not totally happy with was the WiFi in my room, but I just turned it off and relied on AT&T.The bed was really comfortable and the carpet was CLEAN!  Imagine that, a hotel with a clean carpet. Dinner at the CUT (Wolfgang Puck) was perfect.  The wine list far reaching and tasty.  Food prepared to perfection and beautifully presented.I could go on and on but it’s getting late.  No more Ritz or Regency for me.  Thank you Four Seasons, I’ll be back..."
